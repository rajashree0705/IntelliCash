## Run the code locally üöÄüßë‚Äçüíª

IntelliCash is fully open-source, allowing you to run it locally on your device. Whether you‚Äôre curious about how the app works, planning to contribute, or simply exploring, this guide provides all the steps to get started.


### Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è

Before running IntelliCash, ensure you have the following tools installed:

1. **Flutter SDK**: Follow the [official installation guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) to set up Flutter on your system.
2. **Code Editor (Optional)**: Tools like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or Android Studio make managing Flutter projects easier.

### Getting the Project üìÇ

You can choose one of two ways to obtain the project:

### Option 1: Download as ZIP File (No Git Required)

1. Go to the [IntelliCash GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Sudoerz/IntelliCash).
2. Click the green **Code** button, then select **Download ZIP**.
3. Extract the ZIP file to a folder of your choice.

### Option 2: Clone the Repository (Recommended for Contributors)

1. Open a terminal in the folder where you want the project.
2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sudoerz/IntelliCash
   ```

### Installationüì¶

Once you‚Äôve downloaded or cloned the project, navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using Flutter:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Running the App ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

With the setup complete, you can run the app on a connected device or an emulator:

```bash
flutter run
```

If everything is set up correctly, the app will launch, and you‚Äôll be able to test its features locally.


## Contributing üôãüèª

### How to get started

### 1. Fork the repo

To start, fork the project. If you are new to this, don't worry! We leave you a guide below, and if you still have problems, you can contact us whenever you wish.

**[How To Fork Guide - by GitHub.com](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)**

After that you should [run your app](https://github.com/Sudoerz/IntelliCash) to check that everything is correct.

### 2. Configure your developer workspace

Once you have the project up and running, you should prepare to develop in Monekin. To make changes to the project and develop on it, the use of **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** as a text editor is strongly recommended. You can use any other code editor, you can even program using Word, but Visual Studio Code is the most widespread editor for Front-End development, and using it guarantees you follow the same work methods as the administrators of this project.

### Visual Studio and Recommended extensions

To increase your productivity on this project, it is strongly recommended to install the recommended extensions. To do this, when you have the project open with Visual Studio Code, you can type `@recommended` in the extensions section, and install all the ones that appear in the list.

And that's it! You're are ready to start.
